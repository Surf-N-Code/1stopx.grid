seogrid.Ai helps enrich data through online research, usage of external tools such as seo keyword analysis

information the user has asked the ai to generate for that column.

# Core Features  
[List and describe the main features of your product. For each feature, include:
1. CSV Upload
- What it does:
User can upload a csv file and the tool reads the data (either comma or simcolon delimited)
- Why it's important:
To start off with some base data, a user can upload some data
- How it works at a high level:
The data read will be displayed in a grid format
2. Grid / Tabular display of data

Grid display of the read csv data
- Why it's important:

# Logical Dependency Chain
- Which features need to be built first (foundation)
Grid / Tabular display of data
then csv import to show the data in tabular format

# Risks and Mitigations  
- Technical challenges
Ai agents to enrich the data required by the client should have a limit on their turns to limit the 
expenses
